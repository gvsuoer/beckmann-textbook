<p>Let's consider some examples. To simplify the expression, <span class="process-math">\(3 + 2 \times 7\text{,}\)</span> recall that the multiplication sign represents repeated addition. An equivalent expression written entirely in terms of addition is <span class="process-math">\(3 + 7 + 7 = 17\text{.}\)</span> Try this with your calculator; do you get this result? Some students want to add 3 and 2 then multiply the result by 7 because the expression is written that way. If you add first to get 5 then multiply by 7, you get 35. This is not equivalent to the original expression. Notice that <span class="process-math">\(35 = (3 + 2) \times 7\text{.}\)</span> In the original expression, only 2 is multiplied by 7. This example helps us understand why multiplication is completed before addition when simplifying <span class="process-math">\(3 + 2 \times 7\text{,}\)</span> and in general.</p>
