<p>The Four Fours activities were designed to help you:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>Have fun with mathematics,</p></li>
<li><p>See how mathematics can be a puzzle to play with,</p></li>
<li><p>Experience how flexible problem solving can be (There were many expressions for each number, allowing you to use your creativity to find them.),</p></li>
<li><p>Persevere in mathematics when you get stuck,</p></li>
<li><p>Review and remember the Order of Operations,</p></li>
<li><p>Recall and use many mathematical operations (+, <span class="process-math">\(-\text{,}\)</span> <span class="times-sign">Ã—</span>, <span class="process-math">\(\div\text{,}\)</span> !, exponentiation),</p></li>
<li><p>Become more familiar with your graphing calculator;s operation, and</p></li>
<li><p>Experience generalization; several numbers could be expressed in the same way using any single digit integer.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>One example of generalization in the <a href="S_fours_extend.html#act-four-nums-prob" class="internal" title="Student Page 1.5: Flexibility with Numbers: Four Numbers Problem">Flexibility with Numbers: Four Numbers Problem</a> is: <span class="process-math">\(2=\frac{1+1}{\sqrt1\sqrt1}=\frac{4+4}{\sqrt4\sqrt4}=\frac{5+5}{\sqrt5\sqrt5}=\frac{8+8}{\sqrt8\sqrt8}=\frac{9+9}{\sqrt9\sqrt9}\text{.}\)</span> This equation works in the same way for 2, 3, 6, and 7. If you replace each numeral with 0! = 1, the number 2 can be represented in this way for 0! and all integers 1 through 9. To generalize this equation, we let n represent any single digit non-zero integer and replace the numerals in the equation with n. The equation becomes <span class="process-math">\(2=\frac{n+n}{\sqrt n\sqrt n}\)</span> indicating that as long as each n in this equation is replaced by the same number, the equation is always equal to 2. The letter n is a variable. It takes the place of a number, allowing us to be free of having to show the equivalence using each number as we did at the beginning of this paragraph. This is a very powerful idea.</p>
