<p>When you were asked to record the functions you found for <a href="S_eyeball_lines.html#act-gulliver" class="internal" title="Student Page 3.3.3: Gulliver Graphs">Gulliver Graphs</a>, did you find the notation a bit strange? Notice that the notation gives important information about the columns of data being related to each other. <span class="process-math">\(W(T)\)</span> indicates that we want to know the wrist measurement in terms of the thumb measurement, instead of just using <span class="process-math">\(W\text{.}\)</span> We read the symbols, <span class="process-math">\(W\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> What do you think <span class="process-math">\(N(W)\)</span> represents? <span class="process-math">\(N(T)\text{?}\)</span></p>
<p>If we want to be very specific, we could indicate <span class="process-math">\(W_F(T_F)\)</span> to indicate the that we want to know the wrist measurements for females in terms of the thumb measurements for females. How would we write the wrist measurement for males in terms of the thumb measurements for males? We are not using subscript notation in <a href="S_eyeball_lines.html#act-gulliver" class="internal" title="Student Page 3.3.3: Gulliver Graphs">Gulliver Graphs</a>, instead opting to use headings to make clear which data sets are being related.</p>
<p>From this point on, we will use function notation to avoid ambiguity in cases where it is necessary to make clear which quantities we are relating.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="S_eyeball_lines.html#function-notation" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
