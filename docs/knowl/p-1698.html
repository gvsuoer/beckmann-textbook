<p>Listen to the story, <span class="booktitle">Bats on Parade</span>, by Kathi Appelt. (Find online a YouTube video of someone reading <span class="booktitle">Bats on Parade</span>.) Read the scenarios found in or adapted from the story. Scenario A describes the characters in the story as they appear in the book. In Scenario B, you will also count the flag bearer as shown in the story. In Scenario C, the story is adapted to include more flag bearers.</p>
<dl class="description-list">
<dt>Scenario A</dt>
<dd><p>The first group has 1 marcher in 1 row. The second group has 2 marchers in each of 2 rows. The third group has 3 marchers in each of 3 rows, and so on.</p></dd>
<dt>Scenario B</dt>
<dd><p>Each group that joins the parade also has a single flag bearer. Include the flag bearer in the number of marchers in each group.</p></dd>
<dt>Scenario C</dt>
<dd><p>Each group that joins the parade has as many flag bearers as columns in the group. For example, the third group of bats marches in 3 rows and 3 columns and has 3 flag bearers.</p></dd>
