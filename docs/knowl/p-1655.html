<p>Melanie's favorite ways to exercise are playing basketball and running. Her goal is to exercise 60 minutes each day, splitting her time between both basketball and running. She also wants to achieve the equivalent of 10,000 steps per day. Playing basketball for one minute is equivalent to taking 130 steps/minute. Running at the rate of 5 miles per hour is equivalent to taking 185 steps per minute.</p>
