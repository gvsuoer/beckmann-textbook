<p>We would expect that the Order of Operations is a universal convention, agreed upon and used everywhere in the world in the same way. This is not the case, as it happens. Consider the case of multiplication and division. The Order of Operations convention used in USA textbooks tells us to complete multiplication and division in the order they appear in an expression, left to right. In Kenya, students are told to complete division first, in the order division arises, then complete multiplication. Simplify the following expressions with each convention. What do you notice?</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
15 \times 21 \div 7 \times 5 \qquad 9 \times 24 \div 6 \div 3 \times 12 \qquad 35 \div 7 \times 18 \div 2 
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">What do you think is happening here? Can you explain why the result is the same regardless of which version of the Order of Operations you use? Think about how multiplication and division are related then rewrite each expression to use only multiplication. Now what do you notice?</p>
