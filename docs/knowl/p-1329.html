<p>Here is another context for solving equations: Let a pawn represent an unknown value of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Let small cubes represent 1. Think about each side of an equation as sitting on a balance scale. Because one side equals the other side of the equation, the scale is balanced. In order to keep a scale balanced, it is necessary to add the same thing to both sides, remove the same thing from both sides, or divide both sides into the same number of groups then remove parts that equal each other from both sides, leaving only one group on each side of the scale. Following are examples that we will solve using this context. (The problems with negative signs and the problems with subtraction symbols require 2 different colors of cubes (pawns), one color to represent positive one (<span class="process-math">\(+x\)</span>), and one color to represent negative one (<span class="process-math">\(-x\)</span>).)</p>
