<p>In <a href="S_new_func.html#act-batty-func" class="internal" title="Student Page 4.1.2: Batty Functions">Batty Functions</a>, you found many equations, most of them non-linear. Relationships between some of the data sets helped you determine other equations. What questions might we ask about the data sets that can be answered using the equations? Brainstorm with your group. Write at least 3 questions about <a href="S_new_func.html#act-batty-func" class="internal" title="Student Page 4.1.2: Batty Functions">Batty Functions</a> that can be answered using one or more of the equations. Share your questions with the class.</p>
<p>Questions that are frequently asked about Batty Functions include:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>How many bats are in group 7? Group <span class="process-math">\(n\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If a group has 37 bats, what is the group number? If a group has <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> bats, what is the group number?</p></li>
<li><p>What is a reasonable domain for each function?</p></li>
<li><p>What is a reasonable range for each function?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Did you ask questions like these? Look at the graphs you drew for <a href="S_new_func.html#act-batty-func" class="internal" title="Student Page 4.1.2: Batty Functions">Batty Functions</a> How can a graph help you answer these questions? How can a table help? Choose some of the questions about <a href="S_new_func.html#act-batty-func" class="internal" title="Student Page 4.1.2: Batty Functions">Batty Functions</a> that you and others wrote. Answer as many of them as you can in context. If you still have questions, write them down to ask once the <a href="S_new_func.html#act-batty-func" class="internal" title="Student Page 4.1.2: Batty Functions">Batty Functions</a> questions have been answered.</p>
<p>Look at the graph in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/fig-parab-ball.html" title="Figure 4.1.0.3">FigureÂ 4.1.0.3</a>. Suppose the graph represents the height, <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> of a ball <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> seconds after it is thrown. Ask and answer similar questions as those above for this context and graph. Can you find the answer exactly in each case? Why or why not?</p>
