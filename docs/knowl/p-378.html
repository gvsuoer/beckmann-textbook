<p>We have made introductions and studied its underlying mathematics. We looked at the order of operations and saw that the order in which we complete operations is purposeful rather than just a convention to memorize. We've experienced finding patterns in the 100s Chart and justifying them with algebra. We've seen mathematics arise in unlikely places. This lesson expands our repertoire of unlikely places for mathematics, magic number puzzles. Could it be that math really is everywhere?</p>
