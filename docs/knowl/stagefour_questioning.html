<p>Once you solve a problem, think back about what you did. Think about your thinking by asking yourself:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>How do I know my solution is correct? How can I convince someone else?</p></li>
<li><p>How did I think about the problem?</p></li>
<li><p>Can I solve the problem in another way?</p></li>
<li><p>How does this problem connect with other problems I have solved?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your goal is to help yourself explain the problem and its solution. This stage helps you mentally file your thoughts about the problem in a category with other similar problems, organizing your new learning into your long-term memory.</p>
