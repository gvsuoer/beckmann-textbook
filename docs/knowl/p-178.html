<p>The rules for simplifying expressions using the Order of Operations serve as a reminder. To recall which operation to complete first it is helpful to think about what each operation represents. There are cautions, however. Sometimes the Order of Operations can lead us to believe that the order in which we perform operations is rigid. We know that expressions like <span class="process-math">\(85 + 27 + 15\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(25 \times 11 \times 4\)</span> can be simplified more easily if we rearrange the terms. We see that <span class="process-math">\(85 + 15 = 100\)</span> so the sum <span class="process-math">\(85 + 27 + 15 = 85 + 15 + 27 = 100 + 27 = 127\text{.}\)</span> We also see that <span class="process-math">\(25 \times 4 = 100\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(25 \times 11 \times 4 = 25 \times 4 \times 11 = 100 \times 11 = 1100\text{.}\)</span> Addition and multiplication are commutative (the order can be changed without changing the result). We also know that we can group numbers differently when they are all combined with addition or with multiplication; this is the associative property: <span class="process-math">\(14 + (16 + 18) = (14 + 16) + 18\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(15 \times (6 \times 17) = (15 \times 6) \times 17\text{.}\)</span> Both of these properties allow us to group and rearrange numbers combined with one of the operations + or x (not both together, though) to put friendlier, easier to combine, numbers together to aid in simplification.</p>
