<p>Math makes sense. Learning mathematics requires making sense by making connections between familiar ideas you encounter in your daily life. You might find that the mathematics you encounter in this course relates to mathematical concepts from your past experiences. Some of it might seem entirely new. Whatever you think of mathematics as you begin this course, it is important that you keep an open mind, bring your creativity into your learning, and try to connect what you are learning to what you already know outside of mathematics.</p>
