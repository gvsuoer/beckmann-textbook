<p>As you might have guessed, there are electronic tools to find regression equations and lines of best fit. Both Desmos and graphing calculators have tools that will determine lines of best fit using the method of least squares. The graphing calculator directions are included at the end of the homework in this lesson. Desmos includes directions in the on-line graphing calculator. To find the Regression directions on Desmos, click on the “?” button in the upper right corner of the screen. At the top of the screen that appears, there is a list of Tours. Choose “Regressions”. Follow the directions using the data set Desmos provides. Use Desmos' directions to enter and analyze additional data sets.</p>
<p>In this lesson, use Desmos or a graphing calculator to find a regression equation to fit the Wave data. How close does your eyeballed line of best fit approximate the regression line? How long would it take to complete the wave if 100 people participated? How many people would have to participate to keep the wave going for 10 minutes?</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_lin_reg.html#activity-7" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
