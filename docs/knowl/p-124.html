<p>In this activity, in turn, you will introduce yourself using alliteration. You will also introduce everyone who was introduced before you. Suppose the first 3 persons are Char, Ben, and Melanie. Char starts by saying: “I'm Char. I like shopping in Chicago.” Ben says, “I'm Ben. I like baseball. This is Char; she likes shopping in Chicago.” Melanie might say, “I'm Melanie, I like making meals. This is Ben; he likes baseball. This is Char; she likes shopping in Chicago.” Introductions continue around the room with successive students introducing everyone who came before them. If there are 30 students or more in class, the first half of the students introduce themselves using this scheme, then the second half does the same starting over with the first person of the second group.</p>
