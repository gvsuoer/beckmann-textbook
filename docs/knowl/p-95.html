<p>Use tables and graphs to help you make sense of information you find when solving a problem. Don't underestimate the power of trying a few numbers to see what happens. Always keep track of what you try. Do not erase or throw away attempts that don't work. Save them and compare them to an approach that did finally work. Ask yourself these questions: What was I thinking initially? What do I now know? Was I far off at the beginning? If not, what was I thinking that could have led me to a correct solution? If so, what was I thinking that was helpful? What was getting in the way of my understanding?</p>
