<div class="introduction">
<p>In this activity, in turn, you will introduce yourself using alliteration. You will also introduce everyone who was introduced before you. Suppose the first 3 persons are Char, Ben, and Melanie. Char starts by saying: “I'm Char. I like shopping in Chicago.” Ben says, “I'm Ben. I like baseball. This is Char; she likes shopping in Chicago.” Melanie might say, “I'm Melanie, I like making meals. This is Ben; he likes baseball. This is Char; she likes shopping in Chicago.” Introductions continue around the room with successive students introducing everyone who came before them. If there are 30 students or more in class, the first half of the students introduce themselves using this scheme, then the second half does the same starting over with the first person of the second group.</p>
<p>Once introductions have been made, complete the following:</p>
</div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>Create a table to show the number of introductions made by each of the first 5 people and also the total number of introductions made so far.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Look for and share any patterns you see in the table.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Determine the total number of introductions that have been made after 10 people, 15 people, and 20 people.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(d)</span></h5>
<p>Is there a way to find the number of introductions made by the whole class? How? What is the number? How do you know?</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_mathmindset.html#act-introductions" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
