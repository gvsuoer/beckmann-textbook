<p>Sometimes students find it difficult to determine an equation from a table, a graph, or a story. These three representations are highly linked. If you can find a table from a graph or a story, you can always find an equation from the patterns in the table. The student page, <a href="S_distinguish.html#act-slope-int" class="internal" title="Student Page 2.6.3: Finding Equations from Tables and Interpreting Slope and y-Intercept">Finding Equations from Tables and Interpreting Slope and y-Intercept</a>, gives you a few tools to help you find an equation from a table. Though initially, this work might seem time-consuming, complete it as directed. It is important not to simplify too soon so that you can see how patterns are forming. You will find short-cuts soon enough.</p>
