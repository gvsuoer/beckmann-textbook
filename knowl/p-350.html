<p>Throughout this chapter, you have experienced how problems can be approached in a variety of ways. For example, to solve arithmetic problems such as 43 âˆ’ 28, students found at least 8 ways to do this. Using four fours and four numbers, you found many ways to express most of the numbers 1 through 20. You found many patterns in the 100s chart. By now, we hope you are finding that mathematics is a way of thinking and communicating that can be very creative. One of the hallmarks of mathematics is sense-making in your own way, not in a way prescribed for you. In this lesson you will use your creativity based in sense making to find more ways to simplify an arithmetic expression and look for more patterns in the 100s Chart.</p>
