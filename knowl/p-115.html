<p>Homework provides you the opportunity to grow your brain outside of class. It also prepares you to think about problems that build on your homework when you are in class. Making mistakes is an important part of learning, so grading your early thoughts about a topic is counterproductive. <em class="emphasis">Doing</em> homework, however, grows your brain, allows you to get more out of the work you're doing in class, and helps you prepare for your future with technical information. Not doing homework is detrimental to you, and to your current and future work!</p>
