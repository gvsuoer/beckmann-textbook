<div class="introduction"><p>Gavin wants to start-up a food truck that uses locally grown ingredients. He plans to sell crepes and smoothies; he will offer different types of each item. In this case, you need a variation of the <abbr class="initialism">QRV</abbr> table to find each equation needed to solve the system.</p></div>
<article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(a)</span></h5>
<p>Gavin expects to spend on average $0.70 for ingredients for each crepe and $1.20 for ingredients for each smoothie. He wants to spend only $200 for ingredients each day. Write an equation showing the relationship between costs per item and amount spent on food per day.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(b)</span></h5>
<p>Gavin wants to sell crepes for $4 each and smoothies for $5 each. He hopes to take in $1000 each day selling just these two items. Write an equation showing the relationship between the prices he will charge and the amount he will take in each day.</p></article><article class="task exercise-like"><h5 class="heading"><span class="codenumber">(c)</span></h5>
<p>Use the equations from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exer-crepe-costs.html" title="Task 3.7.3.2.a">Task 3.7.3.2.a</a> and <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exer-crepe-sell.html" title="Task 3.7.3.2.b">Task 3.7.3.2.b</a> to determine how many crepes and how many smoothies Gavin should be prepared to sell each day to reach his goals. Solve the problem in at least 2 different ways.</p></article></article><span class="incontext"><a href="S_qrv_tables.html#exercise-394" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
