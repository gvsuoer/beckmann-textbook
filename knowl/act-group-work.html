<blockquote class="blockquote">If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together.</blockquote>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Before you work on math together, complete this activity. Use the cooperative learning strategy, <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/roundtable.html" title="Task 1.a">Task 1.a</a>, to generate ideas.</p>

<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Each team uses a single sheet of paper.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The team member closest to the classroom door writes down an idea, states it out loud, and passes the paper to the left.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Other group members may ask for clarification but may not critique the idea.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Continue until time is called.</p></article><div class="conclusion">
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This activity will help improve group interactions. Teachers who have tried this activity have been pleased by students’ thoughtful responses and found students’ thoughts and words helpful in creating a positive and supportive environment. Use <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/roundtable.html" title="Task 1.a">Task 1.a</a> to reflect on things you like people to say or do in a group when you are working together. After you have thought of and written down a few of the ideas, use <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/roundtable.html" title="Task 1.a">Task 1.a</a> to reflect on things you don’t like people to say or do when you are working in a group.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Some important ideas students generally share include: Let everyone share their ideas, share different ways to solve a problem, listen when others speak, don’t give away the answer, don’t rush through the work, and don’t ignore other people’s ideas.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">When the class has finished brainstorming, share ideas on a “What we like” poster with each group contributing at least one idea. Do the same for a “What we don’t like” poster. Post the final posters in class as the agreed upon classroom norms; refer back to them throughout the course, as needed. Don’t include negative comments such as, “I don’t like waiting for slow people,” instead discuss the issue.</p>
