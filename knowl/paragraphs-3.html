<p>The Grand Valley State University Libraries strive to ensure our tools, devices, services, and environments are available to and usable by as many people as possible.</p>
<p>The web version of <span class="booktitle">Beginning Algebra Made Useful</span> incorporates the following features to support accessibility:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>All content can be navigated by use of a keyboard</p></li>
<li><p>Links, headings, and tables have been designed to work with screen readers</p></li>
<li><p>Mathematics in PreTeXt are rendered with MathJax so they can be understood by using screen readers and/or other assistive devices.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, an instructor should note that nearly all exercises and activities in the text rely on visual interaction, for example: counting images, comparing figures, or describing a graph. These activities cannot be made accessible through alt text or an in-text description.</p>
<p>This accessibility challenge was beyond the <abbr class="initialism">GVSU</abbr> Libraries' capacity to address in the course of this adaptation. Full accessibility may require a comprehensive redesign of the learning activities by educators with expertise in mathematics pedagogy.</p>
<p>We are always looking for how we can make our resources more accessible. If you are having problems accessing this resource, please <a class="external" href="mailto:oer@gvsu.edu" target="_blank">contact us by email</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-5-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> to let us know.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="preface-2.html#paragraphs-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
