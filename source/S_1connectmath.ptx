  <title>Connecting Mathematics Through Representations</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Much of mathematics involves the study of patterns. Making sense of patterns happens through interconnections among 
      representations. In <xref ref="S_connectmath"/>, we begin with a visual growing pattern of dots, connect it with a pattern 
      of numbers, and graphs that model different interpretations of the pattern. Finally, we connect the pattern to a familiar 
      context. All of these representations help us makes sense of one or more aspects of how the pattern is growing, how to 
      analyze it, and how to generalize it.

    <title>Video: Brain Crossing</title>
    
    <p>
      The video shares some important new research on the power of engaging with numbers and symbols visually, which involves 
      brain crossing. Your brain is capable of learning through visual cues, especially if you connect them to other modes of 
      learning. The video explains that it is helpful for all students to think visually about mathematics. <q>Brain Crossing</q>

      When you work on a new problem, try to connect the work you're doing to problems you've worked on in the past. Connecting related mathematics problems helps reduce your reliance on memorized procedures. It also helps move your working (short-term) memory into long-term memory so that it can be retrieved to help you make sense of new problems and concepts.
