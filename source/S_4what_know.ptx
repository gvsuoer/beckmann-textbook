  <title>What Do You Know about Functions?</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="S_big_ideas"/>, you reviewed the big ideas of linear functions. From your work in <xref first="S_new_func" last="S_func_fams"/>, what do you think are the big ideas of quadratic functions? Brainstorm with your group. Write each new idea on an index card or a sticky note. Arrange the cards or sticky notes in a way that shows how ideas are linked to each other. Your arrangement is a concept map. When your group is satisfied with your concept map, compare your concept map to that of other groups. Add any ideas you missed. Discuss with the class any ideas that you think are misplaced or that could be placed differently.

    <title>Linear, Quadratic, and Other Functions Card Sort</title>
    
    <page>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Can you distinguish linear from quadratic and other functions? The function card sort helps you think about similarities and differences among functions. See if you can find cards with functions that belong to the same function family.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <p>
      There are three groups of cards in <xref ref="fig-func-card-sort"/>. Functions on Cards 1 through 5 are represented in context and as tables. Functions on Cards 6 through 10 are represented through practical situations. Functions on Cards 11 through 15 are represented through children's literature. Cards in the same function family do not represent the same equation in this case.

          The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale rates a hurricane's intensity using wind speed and storm surge, which is the abnormal rise in sea level accompanying a hurricane or other intense storm. The scale also estimates the potential damage and flooding expected along the coast from a hurricane landfall.
