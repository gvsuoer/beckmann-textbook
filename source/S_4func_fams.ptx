  <title>Overview</title>
  
  
    <p>
      In <xref ref="C_lin_funcs"/> and <xref ref="C_use_lin_funcs"/>, we saw that linear functions have very predictable behaviors depending on the values of m and b in the equation, <m>y = mx + b</m>. All linear functions are members of the linear function family. Each function family has a parent function, the member of the function family in its most basic form. The parent of the linear function family is the function <m>y = x</m> or in function notation, <m>f(x) = x</m>. In this form, we see <m>m = 1</m> and <m>b = 0</m>. In <xref ref="S_func_fams"/>, we examine other families of functions.

    <title>Transformation of Functions</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In this activity, we examine the absolute value function family whose parent function is <m>f(x) = |x|</m> and the quadratic function family whose parent function is <m>f(x) = x^2</m>. To investigate these function families, we need three different parameters, <m>a</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>k</m>. By changing each parameter, we will see how changes in <m>a</m>, <m>h</m>, and <m>k</m> affect the graphs of the parent functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin, we create a large coordinate plane on the floor with both <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes labeled from <m>-10</m> to 10. Volunteers use string to mark the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes and sticky notes to label the axes. (Use 3 <times/> 3 inch sticky notes or larger to label the axes). Make the grid large enough so that volunteers can stand next to each other on the <m>x</m>-axis. A tiled floor is very helpful!
      </p>
      <p>
        We also need to prepare a set of hang tags that volunteers can wear. Tags can be made from light color cardstock. Punch a hole in the center of a short side, thread string, yarn, or ribbon through the hole so the tag can hang round a volunteer's neck. Label each tag with values of <m>x</m> between <m>-10</m> and 10. It is helpful if numbers are not all the same distance apart and if the positive numbers chosen are not all the same as the absolute value of the negative numbers chosen. A possible set of numbered tags might include: <m>-10</m>, <m>-7</m>, <m>-4</m>, <m>-1</m>, 0, 2, 5, 8, and 10.
