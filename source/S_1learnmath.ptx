  <title>Learning How to Learn Mathematics</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Mathematics is a creative endeavor. It is full of <q>aha</q> moments. Has that been your experience with mathematics? If so, 
      think of a few <q>aha</q> moments you've had. Write them down. If not, you’re about to embark on real learning of 
      mathematics, learning that does not involve mind-numbing memorization of rules for combining symbols and solving equations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Math makes sense. Learning mathematics requires making sense by making connections between familiar ideas you encounter 
      in your daily life. You might find that the mathematics you encounter in this course relates to mathematical concepts 
      from your past experiences. Some of it might seem entirely new. Whatever you think of mathematics as you begin this 
      course, it is important that you keep an open mind, bring your creativity into your learning, and try to connect what 
      you are learning to what you already know outside of mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are several tools available to help you learn mathematics. In <xref ref="S_learnmath"/>, 
      we explore some of them.

    <title>Good Questions to Ask Yourself</title>
    <p>
      When working on mathematics problems, you are in good company if you find that you are often or occasionally stuck. 
      There is always hope. The questions that follow have been used many times to help students find a way out of a temporary 
      dilemma when solving a problem. First, try to identify what’s causing your dilemma. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you understand what the problem is asking? If not, you are probably stuck at Stage 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you understand the problem but don’t know what to do now? You are likely stuck at Stage 2.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you started to solve the problem and gathered some information but don’t know what to do with what you’ve 
      found? You might be stuck at Stage 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you finished the problem? Stage 4 questions can help you organize what you’ve learned through solving the 
      problem into what you already know and help you move new learnings into your long-term memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goldin (1998) suggests a hierarchy of four stages of questioning to guide yourself or a peer to solve a problem:

      <title>Stage 1: Understanding the Problem</title>
      <p>
        Read the problem and take time to make some initial progress on it. Ask yourself:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              What is the problem asking me to do? Write down ideas in your own words.

        If you understand the problem and have trouble starting to solve it, think about general problem-solving strategies 
        that might help. Ask yourself:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Would drawing a picture help?

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Would a table of values help to solve this problem?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Would any materials help to model the problem? (Get the materials and use them.)

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is there a similar problem I’ve done before that might help me get started?

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              What do I know must happen in the problem?

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              What do I know cannot happen in the problem?

      <title>Stage 3: Carrying Out the Plan</title>
      <p>
        If you get stuck once you are partway through solving the problem, think about more specific problem-solving 
        strategies. Ask yourself:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>

            <p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              What information does the graph give me?

    <subsubsection xml:id="subsubsec-stagefour">
      <title>Stage Four: Looking Back</title>
      <p>
        Once you solve a problem, think back about what you did. Think about your thinking by asking yourself:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              How do I know my solution is correct? How can I convince someone else?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How did I think about the problem? 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Can I solve the problem in another way?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How does this problem connect with other problems I have solved?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your goal is to help yourself explain the problem and its solution. This stage helps you mentally file your thoughts 
        about the problem in a category with other similar problems, organizing your new learning into your long-term memory.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-practices">
    <title>Other Helpful Practices</title>
    <p>
      To best learn mathematics, you will find that each of the following strategies are helpful if you make them a habit:
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Read carefully.</em> It might be necessary to read problems or narration several times in order to understand more 
      fully what each intends. Students who do not read carefully always make mistakes that can be remedied by rereading more 
      carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Organize your work.</em> Use tables and graphs to help you make sense of information you find when solving a problem. 
      Don’t underestimate the power of trying a few numbers to see what happens. Always keep track of what you try. Do not 
      erase or throw away attempts that don’t work. Save them and compare them to an approach that did finally work. Ask 
      yourself these questions: What was I thinking initially? What do I now know? Was I far off at the beginning? If not, 
      what was I thinking that could have led me to a correct solution? If so, what was I thinking that was helpful? What was 
      getting in the way of my understanding?
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Check your solutions to see that they make sense.</em> If a context is given, translate your solutions into the 
      context. Check to make sure any numbers you’re getting from equations, tables, or graphs make sense in the context. 
      Make sure graphs, tables, and equations give corresponding information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Never give up!</em> It’s OK to take a break from a problem that’s frustrating you. Return to it after you’ve had a 
      chance to relieve your frustration. You can learn mathematics. You can solve any problem facing you, <em>as long as you 
      never give up!</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Study</em> at least a little <em>most days</em>. After each class, take 15 minutes to write down what you learned. 
      Be specific. For example, don’t state, <q>I learned about linear functions.</q> Instead, state specifically what you 
      learned, <q>I learned that the slope of a linear function when shown in a graph is the value of <m>m</m> in the equation, 
      <m>y = mx + b</m>. This makes sense, because slope is how much <m>y</m> changes when <m>x</m> changes by 1 so in a graph, 
      the <m>y</m>-value of a linear function changes by <m>m</m> every time <m>x</m> changes by 1.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Do your assigned homework.</em> Homework provides you the opportunity to grow your brain outside of class. It also 
      prepares you to think about problems that build on your homework when you are in class. Making mistakes is an important 
      part of learning, so grading your early thoughts about a topic is counterproductive. <em>Doing</em> homework, however, 
      grows your brain, allows you to get more out of the work you’re doing in class, and helps you prepare for your future 
      with technical information. Not doing homework is detrimental to you, and to your current and future work!
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Commit to your education.</em> Participate fully in your group and class and make every effort to complete your 
      homework so that you’re prepared to participate with your group.
