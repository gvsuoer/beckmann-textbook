  <title>Generalizations and Variables: Patterns in the 100s Chart</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We saw that variables can be used to generalize expressions in <xref ref="act-four-nums-prob"/> such as <m>2=\frac{2+2}{\sqrt2\sqrt2}=\frac{6+6}{\sqrt6\sqrt6}=\frac{n+n}{\sqrt n\sqrt n}</m>. Variables can also be used in other ways. In this lesson, you will explore other ways that variables can be used in algebra.

    <title>Video: Brains Grow and Change</title>
    
    <p>
      The video explains that making sense of mathematics is necessary to grow your brain. It shares brain science related to how to strengthen or create new pathways in your brain. If somewhere in your past, you have gotten the idea that you are not a math person, this video might change your point of view! <q>Brains Grow and Change</q> is from <url href="https://bhi61nm2cr3mkdgk1dtaov18-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Brains-Grow-Change.mp4" visual="bhi61nm2cr3mkdgk1dtaov18-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Brains-Grow-Change.mp4">YouCubed.org, Week 4 of Inspirational Math, Day 5</url>.

    <title>Number Talk: 43 <mdash/> 28</title>
    
    <p>
      Number talks help you realize how many different, correct, ways there are to solve the same problem. They help you develop flexibility with numbers. Eventually, we will look for generalizations, extending our number talks into algebra. Consider the following problem:
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <p>
        I had $43 with me when I went shoping last week.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent $28 on fruit. How much do I have left?
      </p>
      <p>
        Solve the problem mentally. Find at least one other way to solve the problem mentally. When asked to do so, share your solution and one of the ways you solved the problem. 
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      When everyone is ready, you will be asked to share your solution. Once all solutions are expressed, you will take turns sharing solution processes you found. When sharing your solution process, answer the questions below:

      <dl>
        <li>
          <title>Answer</title>
          <p>
            Which solution are you defending?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Ask</title>
          <p>
            Does anyone have a question for me?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Ask</title>
          <p>
            Does anyone have another way to solve the problem?
          </p>
        </li>
      </dl>
      Remember, your brain grows when you make mistakes and even more when you resolve them.

    <title>Analyzing the 100s Chart</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Generalization is an important concept in algebra. It is the basis of the use of variables. Think about what the word, variable, means when you are not thinking about mathematics. Share your ideas about this.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will continue to refine our meaning of variable through today's activities. Work on <xref text='title' ref="act-analyze100"/>. As with the Four Fours collection of activities, use your creativity. Work to give clear descriptions of any patterns you find. Color code each pattern and illustrate it in the same color on the 100s Chart.

          You probably have learned to combine like terms in previous mathematics classes. As with the Order of Operations, there are mathematical reasons underlying which terms can be combined. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When children learn to multiply, they use arrays such as those in <xref ref="fig-like-terms-array"/> to make sense of repeated addition. The product of the dimensions of an array is the number of squares in the array; the number of rows shows how many times the number of squares in the first row is repeated. <xref text='title' ref="act-like-terms"/> builds on this experience in learning multiplication to help you think about the meaning of the terms 1, <m>x</m>, and <m>x^2</m> in the context of area as you model expressions with algebra tiles. Complete <xref text='title' ref="act-like-terms"/>. Write down any questions you have as you work so you can ask them in class.

          There are free apps online to help you make sense of combining like terms and adding polynomials using algebra tiles. <url href="http://media.mivu.org/mvu_pd/a4a/homework/index.html" visual="media.mivu.org/mvu_pd/a4a/homework/index.html">Use the apps on this website</url>. Read the introductory pages carefully. These pages tell you how to use the apps. Navigate through the introduction using the arrow in the upper right corner. Watch the videos and play with the apps for <pubtitle>Simplifying Expressions and Adding Polynomials</pubtitle>. Solve at least 2 problems at each difficulty level, until you conceptually understand the link between the algebra tiles and the expressions they represent. This work should take at most 20 minutes.
