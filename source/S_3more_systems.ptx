    <p>
      In the <xref ref="hmwk-35"/>, you determined how to solve a system of equations graphically. You also determined how to solve a system of equations algebraically when the equations were presented in the form, <m>y = mx + b</m>. In <xref ref="S_more_systems"/>, you will play a game to hone your new-found skills then determine and analyze a system for which the equations are not in the form, <m>y = mx + b</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              Draw a line that goes through two or more points on the gameboard. <em>All lines must be functions</em>. (What types of lines does this rule eliminate?)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              State a correct equation for the line you drew.

                  <p>

                  <p>
                    1 point for algebraically determining the intersection point of your line with another line. The intersection point cannot be a point already on the gameboard.

      <p>
        Use pretzel sticks and cheerios to measure an 8.5-inch by 11-inch sheet of paper. The student page provides an interesting way to measure something if conventional tools are not available. As a bonus, you get to eat the pretzels and the cheerios when you're done measuring!

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In the cartoon, <pubtitle>Foxtrot</pubtitle>, Paige is frustrated by a system of equations problem she has to solve for homework. (See <url href="https://www.gocomics.com/foxtrot/2009/01/25/" visual="gocomics.com/foxtrot/2009/01/25/">gocomics.com</url>, retrieved April 23, 2020.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The system is:
          <md>
            <mrow>2x + y \amp = 60</mrow>
            <mrow>x + 2y \amp = 75</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
        <p>
          Her older brother asked her, <q>If 2 shirts and a sweater costs $60 and a shirt and 2 sweaters costs $75, what does each item cost?</q> Paige solved the problem immediately but didn't realize she had done so. 
        </p>
      </introduction>

      <task>

            Show Paige how to solve the system of equations in her homework. Use two different methods to solve the problem.
