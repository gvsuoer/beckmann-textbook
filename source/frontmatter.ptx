    <title>Preface</title>
    
    
    <p>
      <pubtitle>Beginning Algebra Made Useful</pubtitle> addresses the needs of learners to make sense of algebra by quantifying and generalizing 
      everyday occurrences such as commuting to work, buying gas or pizza, and determining the better deal.  It requires 
      learners to actively engage with algebraic concepts through physical and thought experiments in ways that help them 
      connect ideas, representations, and contexts, and solve problems that arise in their daily lives.  The text helps 
      learners grow their brains and develop growth mindsets as they learn algebra conceptually.  Problem sets continue the 
      process, extending work begun in each lesson, applying new understandings to new contexts, and considering ideas that 
      arise more fully in upcoming lessons.  Longer assignments that can be used as group projects are included in the text. 
      Group work is encouraged throughout the text; suggestions for orchestrating group work are included.
    </p>

    <p>
      This text is different from most existing beginning algebra texts in several ways: The text is free for download by 
      students and instructors in .pdf format; in the electronic format, graphics are in full color and there are live html 
      links to resources, software, and applets; the text is open source, and interested instructors can gain access to the 
      original source files upon request.

      <title>Comparison With Other Versions</title>
      
      <p>
        This textbook is a <pretext /> edition of <url href="https://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/books/25/" visual="scholarworks.gvsu.edu/books/25/">Beginning Algebra Made Useful" by Charlene E. Beckmann</url>, originally published in <init>PDF</init> only. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This version has identical content, but readers of both editions may encounter minor differences in formatting and page layout.

      <title>Accessibility Statement</title>
      
      <p>
        The Grand Valley State University Libraries strive to ensure our tools, devices, services, and environments are available to and usable by as many people as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The web version of <pubtitle>Beginning Algebra Made Useful</pubtitle> incorporates the following features to support accessibility:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              All content can be navigated by use of a keyboard
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Links, headings, and tables have been designed to work with screen readers
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Mathematics in <pretext /> are rendered with MathJax so they can be understood by using screen readers and/or other assistive devices.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, an instructor should note that nearly all exercises and activities in the text rely on visual interaction, for example: counting images, comparing figures, or describing a graph. These activities cannot be made accessible through alt text or an in-text description. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This accessibility challenge was beyond the <init>GVSU</init> Libraries' capacity to address in the course of this adaptation. Full accessibility may require a comprehensive redesign of the learning activities by educators with expertise in mathematics pedagogy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are always looking for how we can make our resources more accessible. If you are having problems accessing this resource, please <url href="mailto:oer@gvsu.edu" visual="mailto:oer@gvsu.edu">contact us by email</url> to let us know.
