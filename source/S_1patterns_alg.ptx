  <introduction>
    <p>
      As in <xref ref="S_more_patterns"/> some of our number talks are related to our work with the 100s Chart. Solve the next problem in as many ways as you can. Think about how it is related to the 100s Chart (<xref ref="hunds-chart"/>).

    <title>Number Talk: 96 + 29</title>

    <assemblage>
      <p>
        Mentally solve 96 + 29 in as many ways as you can. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Raise a thumb when you have a solution. Raise a finger for each additional solution process you find.

    <title>Sharing Rectangle Patterns in the 100s Chart</title>
    
    <statement>
      <p>
        Share your justifications of patterns you found for homework with your group. As a group, decide which two patterns to justify in words and algebraically for the class. For your algebraic justification, label your rectangle as generally as you can, with <m>x</m> as the upper left corner of the rectangle and the other numbers in the rectangle based on <m>x</m>.
