  <title>Using Quantity Rate Value Tables to Determine Equations</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Half the battle in solving a system of equations has to do with finding the equations in the first place. In <xref ref="S_qrv_tables"/>, you will learn a convenient tool to help you set up equations for problems that involve rates.

    <title>Setting Up Systems of Equations with Quantity Rate Value Tables</title>
    
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        This activity guides you in creating a system of equations based on known information in a context. Contexts well-suited for use of <init>QRV</init> tables generally involve two unknown quantities that are added together to get a total, different rates (price per pound, price per ticket, level of acidity, etc.) for each quantity, and a value obtained by multiplying the rate by the corresponding quantity. Read carefully and make sense of each step as you solve the problems below.

          The admission fee at the Grand Rapids Public Museum is $3 for children and $8 for adults. One day 575 people paid to enter the museum. The museum collected $3450 for admissions.
