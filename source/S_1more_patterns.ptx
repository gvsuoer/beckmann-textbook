  <title>More with Patterns and Variables: Rectangular Patterns in the 100s Chart</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Throughout this chapter, you have experienced how problems can be approached in a variety of ways. For example, to solve arithmetic problems such as 43 <minus/> 28, students found at least 8 ways to do this. Using four fours and four numbers, you found many ways to express most of the numbers 1 through 20. You found many patterns in the 100s chart. By now, we hope you are finding that mathematics is a way of thinking and communicating that can be very creative. One of the hallmarks of mathematics is sense-making in your own way, not in a way prescribed for you. In this lesson you will use your creativity based in sense making to find more ways to simplify an arithmetic expression and look for more patterns in the 100s Chart.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="SS_nums93-27">
    <title>Number Talk: 93 <minus/> 27</title>
    <p>
      Solve the following problem in as many ways as you can.
    </p>
    <assemblage>
      <p>
        Mentally solve 93 <minus/> 27 in as many ways as you can.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raise a thumb when you have a solution. Raise a finger for each additional solution process you find.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      One way a student solved 93 <minus/> 27 was by adding 3 to both 93 and 27 to get 96 <minus/> 30 = 66. The student also solved the problem by adding 4 to both numbers to get 97 <minus/> 31 = 66. Does this strategy always work? Why or why not? Is the student's process related to the 100s chart? Find the numbers on <xref ref="hunds-chart"/> and explain what's happening to the numbers. Use algebra to explain why this process works.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        In <xref text='title' ref="act-analyze100"/> you found patterns in rows, columns, or diagonals. This time your pattern search will be confined to rectangles.

          What patterns do you notice among the numbers in one of the rectangles? Find at least three patterns. Each pattern you find must not extend beyond the rectangle.

      <p>
        As a group, choose your 3 favorite patterns, including at least one that you think other groups won't find. Share your patterns with the class. As a group, choose 2 patterns shared by other groups to justify. Use variables and algebra to justify that each pattern works.
