  <title>Algebra and Number Puzzles</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We have made introductions and studied its underlying mathematics. We looked at the order of operations and saw that the order in which we complete operations is purposeful rather than just a convention to memorize. We've experienced finding patterns in the 100s Chart and justifying them with algebra. We've seen mathematics arise in unlikely places. This lesson expands our repertoire of unlikely places for mathematics, magic number puzzles. Could it be that math really is everywhere?
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout human history of the past 2000 years, humans have been fascinated by puzzles. In this lesson, we play with some of them and see how they are related to algebra.

        Consider these two magic number puzzles.

        <assemblage>
          <title>Number Puzzle 1</title>
          <p>
            Choose a whole number between 1 and 10.
          </p>
          <p>
            Double it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Add 4 to the result.
          </p>
          <p>
            Divide the result by 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Subtract the number you started with.
          </p>
          <p>
            What number to you get?
          </p>
        </assemblage>
      </p>
      <p>
        How does this puzzle work? Act out each step of the puzzle using objects (algebra tiles or blocks and beans will work!) Let one type of object represent <m>x</m> and another type of object represent units. Finally, solve the puzzle using a variable to represent an unknown number and algebra to write then simplify expressions.

        <assemblage>
          <title>Number Puzzle 2</title>
          <p>
            Choose a number.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multiply it by 6.
          </p>
          <p>
            Add 12.
          </p>
          <p>
            Divide the result by 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Add 9.
          </p>
          <p>
            Divide the result by 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            What is your number? How does it compare with your starting number?
          </p>
        </assemblage>

        Determine a solution. Figure out how this puzzle works, first with materials, then with algebra.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discuss the solutions to both puzzles, including justification with materials and with algebra and the relationship between these.
