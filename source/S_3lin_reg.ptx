  <title>Linear Regression and Lines of Best Fit</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the activities and homework for <xref ref="S_eyeball_lines"/>, you might have found a different equation than other members of your group or class. Even if your equations had similar slopes or <m>y</m>-intercepts, it might be disconcerting to use different equations to model the same set of data. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Statisticians worked on the problem of finding lines of best fit over many years. Initially, the idea was to get a line that had as many points above the line as below so that the sum of the distances of points away from the line added to 0. Even though the process worked fairly well, the same problem occurred as in our work with eyeballed lines of best fit. Scientists were not satisfied with estimates that worked most of the time. They wanted precision and a method that was mathematically justifiable. Carl Friedrich Gauss developed the method of least squares to solve celestial problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand the method of least squares, consider an example. In <xref ref="fig-resids"/>, three points and an eyeballed line of best fit are indicated. Each point is connected to the line with a segment the length of which is a residual, the directed distance of the point from the eyeballed line of best fit; a residual is positive if the point lies above the line and negative if the point lies below the line. Notice that the sum of the residuals is 0. In <xref ref="fig-resids-sq"/>, each residual is the same as in <xref ref="fig-resids"/> but this time, a square with side length equal to the residual is drawn. In the method of least squares, the squares of the residuals are found; these are the areas of the squares. The one line that best fits all of the points is the line for which the sum of the areas of the squares is least.

    <title>The Wave</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Let's try another experiment. Think about the Wave as it happens at a football game. Someone starts it and gets most of the people in the stadium standing up and sitting down as the wave approaches then leaves them. We'll practice the wave in the same way, keeping track of how long it takes to complete the wave based on the number of participants in the wave.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use <xref ref="tbl-wave"/> to record the amount of time it takes to complete a wave for the given number of participants.

        As you might have guessed, there are electronic tools to find regression equations and lines of best fit. Both Desmos and graphing calculators have tools that will determine lines of best fit using the method of least squares. The graphing calculator directions are included at the end of the homework in this lesson. Desmos includes directions in the on-line graphing calculator. To find the Regression directions on Desmos, click on the <q>?</q> button in the upper right corner of the screen. At the top of the screen that appears, there is a list of Tours. Choose <q>Regressions</q>. Follow the directions using the data set Desmos provides. Use Desmos' directions to enter and analyze additional data sets.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this lesson, use Desmos or a graphing calculator to find a regression equation to fit the Wave data. How close does your eyeballed line of best fit approximate the regression line? How long would it take to complete the wave if 100 people participated? How many people would have to participate to keep the wave going for 10 minutes?
