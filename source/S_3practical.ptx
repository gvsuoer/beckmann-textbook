    <title>Overview</title>
    
    
    <p>
      In <xref ref="C_lin_funcs"/>, we became familiar with graphs, tables, and equations, particularly where each represents a linear function. We also investigated many contexts that can be modeled by linear functions. In this chapter, we introduce several others. Our goals for <xref ref="C_use_lin_funcs"/> include solving equations and interpreting the solutions to help you make decisions about each context. The examples we study might trigger your recall of situations in your life that can be modeled by linear functions. Let's begin with pricing pizza!

    <title>Pricing Pizzas</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Pizza restaurants let you customize your pizza. You can also order specialty pizzas. Are you getting a good deal? If so, how good is the deal are you getting? If not, why is the deal not so good?
      </p>
      <p>
        Work together to analyze the pricing of a pizza restaurant. Use a pizza restaurant's website for a location close to you as sometimes different locations of the same chain charge different prices. Each group should choose a different pizza size or crust type to investigate. Fill in the table as you go and share your work with the class.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Play with a pizza restaurant's online menu to determine prices requested in the table below. Check prices on more than one ingredient to determine if the prices are the same or different based on ingredient type. For example, are meats more expensive than veggies? Fill-in <xref ref="tbl-pizza-prices"/>.

          Solve each equation. Show your steps one at a time. Put your solution back into the original equation and show that you are correct. If you are not correct, illustrate your work using pawns for x and cubes for constants. Use the illustration to solve the equation then revisit your algebraic work, find your error, and try again. Think about a context such as balancing a scale to help you. Be ready to convince others that your work is correct.

    <title>Solving Equations <mdash/> Hands and Minds On</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        When set in context, it is easier to decide how to solve an equation. For example, when trying to determine how many toppings you can get on a large original pizza for $25, you might have thought about the solution in one of the following ways:
      

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          An original crust large cheese pizza costs $10.99. To figure out the number of toppings I can get, I see that I have <m>\$25 - \$10.99 = \$14.01</m> to spend on toppings. Each topping costs $1.50. (Parts a, b, and c are different possible ways to proceed from here.)
        

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            I can find the number of toppings I can afford by dividing $14.01 by $1.50. This gives me 9.34. The pizza restaurant will only allow me to buy whole numbers of toppings so I can get 9 toppings on a $25 large original crust pizza.
          </p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <p>
            If I start with $14.01 and subtract 1.50 until I can't subtract it anymore, I can do that 9 times, so I can afford 9 toppings on my pizza if I have $25 to spend.
          </p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <p>
            Two toppings cost $3. $3 <times/> 4 = $12 with $2.01 left over for one more topping. So I can afford 8 toppings + 1 topping = 9 toppings for $25.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </li>

    </ol>

    </p>
    </introduction>

    <p>
      Notice that it helps to keep the context in mind. The context helps you make sense of the operations you are using. This allows you to be very flexible with the ways you solve the problem because you know what each of the parts represent.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is another context for solving equations: Let a pawn represent an unknown value of <m>x</m>. Let small cubes represent 1. Think about each side of an equation as sitting on a balance scale. Because one side equals the other side of the equation, the scale is balanced. In order to keep a scale balanced, it is necessary to add the same thing to both sides, remove the same thing from both sides, or divide both sides into the same number of groups then remove parts that equal each other from both sides, leaving only one group on each side of the scale. Following are examples that we will solve using this context. (The problems with negative signs and the problems with subtraction symbols require 2 different colors of cubes (pawns), one color to represent positive one (<m>+x</m>), and one color to represent negative one (<m>-x</m>).)
    </p>

        <cell right="minor"><m>2x -1 = 3</m></cell>

      <row bottom="minor">
        <cell right="minor"><m>3 \left( x - 1 \right) = x + 3</m></cell>
        <cell right="minor"><m>-2x + 6 = x</m></cell>
      </row>
      
    </tabular>

    <p>
      Now resolve the above problems, this time thinking of <m>x</m> as some unknown number of bananas.  The constants (those numbers not multiplied by <m>x</m>) are known numbers of bananas. (Omit the problems with subtraction symbols and the problems with negative signs.)
