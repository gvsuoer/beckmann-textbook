    <title>Organizing Your Work: Ways to Use 1, 2, or 3 Fours to Make Other Numbers</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        In mathematics, it is often helpful to create an organized list. <xref text='title' ref="act-organize"/> helps you organize expressions you have found using fewer than 4 fours. 
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
      <p>
        As you worked on the Four Fours Problem, you likely found many ways to combine fewer than 4 fours. Use this table to organize what you've found. Find other ways to combine 1, 2, or 3 fours to make other numbers. For each column, order the combinations you find least to greatest.

              Experience generalization; several numbers could be expressed in the same way using any single digit integer.

        One example of generalization in the <xref text='title' ref="act-four-nums-prob"/> is: <m>2=\frac{1+1}{\sqrt1\sqrt1}=\frac{4+4}{\sqrt4\sqrt4}=\frac{5+5}{\sqrt5\sqrt5}=\frac{8+8}{\sqrt8\sqrt8}=\frac{9+9}{\sqrt9\sqrt9}</m>. This equation works in the same way for 2, 3, 6, and 7. If you replace each numeral with 0! = 1, the number 2 can be represented in this way for 0! and all integers 1 through 9. To generalize this equation, we let n represent any single digit non-zero integer and replace the numerals in the equation with n. The equation becomes <m>2=\frac{n+n}{\sqrt n\sqrt n}</m> indicating that as long as each n in this equation is replaced by the same number, the equation is always equal to 2. The letter n is a variable. It takes the place of a number, allowing us to be free of having to show the equivalence using each number as we did at the beginning of this paragraph. This is a very powerful idea.

    <title>Reflecting on Your Group's Work on the Four Numbers Problem</title>
    
    <exercise>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          Share your Four Numbers responses with your group. On your group member's sheet, highlight any expressions you find particularly interesting and any expressions you are unsure of so that you may discuss them together.

            Do you agree with each of the solutions each group member found? If not, resolve any difficulties. Do not erase any of a student's original work. Instead, note any expressions over which group members had differences of opinion on the back of this page. Also indicate how you resolved them.
