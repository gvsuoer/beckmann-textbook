  <title>Analyzing Tile Patterns</title>
  
  <introduction>
    <p>
      You have already experienced that functions arise in a variety of ways. You learned how to determine linear functions given a set of data, a graph, a story, or an equation. In this lesson, you will count tiles arranged in a pattern, determine how the tile arrangement is related to the step number, and analyze growing tile patterns to determine whether or not the resulting data is linear.

      Consider the tile arrangement in <xref ref="fig-pattern-talk-step-3"/>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Count the number of tiles in the arrangement.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            How did you count the tiles?

        <li>
          <p>
            Find a way to count the tiles so that so that the relationship between the number of tiles and the Step Number is evident.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Share your ways of counting the tiles with your group when asked to do so.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Study the tile arrangements in <xref ref="fig-pattern-talk-step-2"/> and <xref ref="fig-pattern-talk-step-1"/>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Does one of the ways you counted the tiles in <xref ref="fig-pattern-talk-step-3"/> also work to count the tiles for both <xref ref="fig-pattern-talk-step-2"/> and <xref ref="fig-pattern-talk-step-1"/>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Is the relationship between the number of tiles and the Step Number still evident for <xref ref="fig-pattern-talk-step-2"/> and <xref ref="fig-pattern-talk-step-1"/>? Explain your counting process and the relationship between the number of tiles and the step number.

    <p>
      In this lesson, you will explore several tile patterns. Each pattern grows in a predictable way. It is your job to determine how each pattern is growing. Some of the patterns are linear or proportional linear. Other patterns are not linear. Can you distinguish which patterns are linear or proportional linear from those that are not? Use what you've learned about linear relationships to help you!

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Use tiles to model each pattern. Use color to show how each pattern grows. For example, choose a color for tiles that are new in Step 2 when compared to Step 1. Use the Step 2 color to show where these same tiles appear in all subsequent steps. Find a way to count each pattern of tiles so that the relationship between the number of tiles and the step number is evident. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Work on Pattern A. When you're done, share the different ways you colored the pattern with your group and when asked to do so, with the class. Use that information to draw Steps 0 and 4 and to find the equation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Continue working on Patterns B through F.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the class has finished work on <xref text="title" ref="act-analyze-tiles"/>, as a group, claim one pattern. You will share your coloring of the pattern and equation with the class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once all patterns are posted, study each group's work. Determine if you agree or disagree and why. When reporting, group members who did not put the pattern on the board will explain the work presented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Study the visual patterns in <xref ref="fig-visual-patterns"/>. Assume each pattern continues infinitely and grows predictably. Determine the following for each pattern:
