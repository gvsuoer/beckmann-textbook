    <p>
    You have seen that graphs can be helpful in representing data. In Lesson 2.2, you will specifically explore the importance of scale when graphing equations.

    <title>Location, Location, Location</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Through this activity your group will create a graph to convey information about the number of people in a location over time. You will also interpret a graph prepared by another group and try to determine a location that fits the graph. To prepare, think about a place you go with some regularity. How many people are in that place at various times during the day? 
      </p>
      <p>
        To maximize the interest level, each group must choose very different types of locations. It helps if the numbers of people who go to the place each day are large. Secrecy of choice is critical! Make sure other groups cannot overhear your group's discussions!
      </p>
      <p>
        Complete the following with your group:
      </p>
    </introduction>
        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Choose a location and a day of the week to analyze. Get your teacher's approval before continuing (to assure that your group chose a unique location).
            </p>
          </statement>
        </exercise>
        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Estimate how many people are likely to be in the location at the beginning of each hour of the day, starting at 6 AM and ending at 5 AM the following day. Record the data.
            </p>

        <exercise>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Create a graph to accurately represent the data.
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Use the horizontal axis to indicate the hour of the day.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Use the vertical axis to indicate the estimated number of people in the location at the beginning of each hour.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Do not include any information on your graph that identifies the location your team is analyzing.

              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              When you have accomplished the above, your teacher will share your graph with another group and provide another group's graph for your group to analyze.

    <title>It's A Matter of Scale</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        How important are the scales chosen for both the horizontal and vertical axes to the appearance of a graph or a group of graphs? Think about this question as you work together on the following tasks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Among groups, compare graphs for <xref ref="exer-scale-3"/> and <xref ref="exer-scale-4a"/>. What do you notice? Think about these questions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Are all of the graphs the same shape?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>

      <p>
        Think about <xref text="title" ref="act-location"/> How important was scale in helping you determine the location of each place? Does the <m>x</m>-scale matter? Does the <m>y</m>-scale matter?

          Starting with zero at the origin, the point where the axes intersect, each tick mark increases by the amount of the scale provided. Label both the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes showing the scale on the card.

        News articles and ads are sometimes accompanied by graphs. Sometimes these graphs are deceiving. Complete <xref text="title" ref="act-critique"/>, in light of what you have learned about scale. In each graph check to see if the <m></m>- and <m>y-</m>scales are correct. Are the distances between each of the <m>x</m>-values to scale?  Are the distances between each of the <m>y</m>-values to scale? How can you tell?

        Plot each graph using an electronic tool. Set the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> scales to be the same as those used in each graph. Compare the appearance of the graph you created with the designed graph.

    <title>Important Features of Graphs</title>
    


  <p>
    Through <xref text="title" ref="act-critique"/>, you had the opportunity to determine important features of accurate, informative graphs. Your list should include:
  </p>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>The Origin</title>
    <p>
      Both the <m>x</m>- and <m>y</m>-axes must include zero. The intersection of the two axes is called the origin. It represents <m>(0, 0)</m>, the place where both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are zero.
    </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Scale</title>
    <p>
      The distance between consecutive tick marks must represent the same distance as the distance between 0 and the first tick mark. The <m>x</m>-scale can be different from the <m>y</m>-scale. Use as much of the graph as possible while still using a scale that is easy to interpret.
    </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Plotting Points</title>
    <p>
      Once the scale is chosen, the data points must be plotted accurately. Each point has 2 coordinates, <m>(x, y)</m>, where <m>x</m> represents a value of the independent variable and <m>y</m> represents the corresponding value of the dependent variable. If the scales for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are chosen so that they are easy to interpret, it is likely the points will be relatively easy to locate and plot.
    </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Labels</title>
    <p>
      Label both axes with the quantities they represent. The <m>x</m>-axis (horizontal) represents the independent variable. The <m>y</m>-axis (vertical) represents the dependent variable. 
    </p>
  </paragraphs>

  <paragraphs>
    <title>Title</title>
    <p>
      In formal documents, a title is necessary. For our purposes, a title on the graph is required when the graph represents data given in context.
    </p>
  </paragraphs>
