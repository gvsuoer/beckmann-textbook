    <introduction>
      <p>
        In <xref text="title" ref="act-trod-tort"/>, continue to model motion with graphs and consider the race between the Hare and the Tortoise in another way. This time, from knowledge of the tortoise's speed, create a table showing the tortoise's distance from the Starting Line at various times during the race. Plot points and consider the appearance of the graph as it relates to the tortoise's speed over several time intervals. Find an equation that models the data. Finally, consider the many ways that the Tortoise's speed arises in the table, graph, and equation. In the end, define slope.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the race between the tortoise and the hare, the fox recorded the speed at which both the tortoise and the hare were traveling. The fox observed that the tortoise plodded along at a rate of 20 meters per minute throughout the 1000-meter race.

Write about your current understanding of slope and the relationships between slope, speed, rate of change in a table of values, and the change in distance divided by the change in time. In particular, how does speed show up in the table? How does it show up in the graph? How does it show up in an equation?

          Revisit <xref ref="act-eyes"/>. The relationships you investigated in <xref ref="act-eyes"/> are called proportional relationships. In linear proportional relationships, you get one quantity by multiplying the other by a constant. Are any of the Tortoise and Hare relationships proportional? See if you can find 2 or 3 examples.
