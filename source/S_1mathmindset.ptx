    <title>Video: Mindset</title>
    <p>
      The message of <q>Mindset</q> is that everyone can learn mathematics. The video includes important brain and mindset 
      evidence to support this message. Watch the video. Write a brief reflection, then discuss the video in small groups. 
      This video is from <url href="https://www.youcubed.org/resources/mindset-video/" visual="youcubed.org/resources/mindset-video/">Week 1 of Inspirational Math, Day 1</url>.

        Before you work on math together, complete this activity. Use the cooperative learning strategy, <xref text='title' ref="mindset-roundtable"/>, to 
        generate ideas.
      </p>
    </introduction>
    
    <paragraphs xml:id="mindset-roundtable">
      <title>Roundtable</title>
      <p>
        Each team uses a single sheet of paper. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The team member closest to the classroom door writes down an idea, states it out loud, and passes the paper to the left. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Other group members may ask for clarification but may not critique the idea. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Continue until time is called.
      </p>
    </paragraphs>

        This activity will help improve group interactions. Teachers who have tried this activity have been pleased by 
        students' thoughtful responses and found students' thoughts and words helpful in creating a positive and supportive 
        environment. Use <xref text='title' ref="mindset-roundtable"/> to reflect on things you like people to say or do in a group when you are working together.
        After you have thought of and written down a few of the ideas, use <xref text='title' ref="mindset-roundtable" /> to reflect on 
        things you don't like people to say or do when you are working in a group.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Some important ideas students generally share include: Let everyone share their ideas, share different ways to solve 
        a problem, listen when others speak, don't give away the answer, don't rush through the work, and don't ignore other 
        people's ideas. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When the class has finished brainstorming, share ideas on a <q>What we like</q> poster with each group contributing at 
        least one idea. Do the same for a <q>What we don't like</q> poster. Post the final posters in class as the agreed upon 
        classroom norms; refer back to them throughout the course, as needed. Don't include negative comments such as, 
        <q>I don't like waiting for slow people,</q> instead discuss the issue.

        Document your current feelings about how you approach mathematics through the following.

    <exercise xml:id="mindset-one">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Look at <xref ref="fig-mindsets"/>. Follow the directions to get a baseline of your attitudes 
          concerning your ability to learn mathematics.

    <exercise xml:id="mindset-two">
      <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The boxes in the first column of <xref ref="fig-mindsets"/> describe a person with a Fixed Mindset. The 
          boxes in the second column describe a person with a Growth Mindset. At the present time, do you tend to have a 
          Fixed Mindset or a Growth Mindset in terms of learning mathematics? Explain why you think so.
        </p>
      </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
        <p>
          Having a Growth Mindset helps you overcome obstacles as you work to learn mathematics. Having a Fixed Mindset, 
          on the other hand, can prevent you from learning mathematics. It is important to work to overcome a Fixed Mindset 
          so that it doesn't hold you back from learning. If you tend to have a Fixed Mindset, what ideas do you have to help 
          you transition from a Fixed to a Growth Mindset?

        <p>
          Keep your responses to <xref ref="mindset-one"/> and <xref ref="mindset-two"/>. Revisit them often. Each time, ask yourself:
          <ul>
            <li>

                Have any of my beliefs changed?

                Do I believe in myself and my ability to learn mathematics?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          If the answer to either question is no, ask yourself:

            <li>
              <p>
                What messages am I giving myself that keep me from believing in myself?

  <activity xml:id="act-introductions">
    <title>Making Introductions</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this activity, in turn, you will introduce yourself using alliteration. You will also introduce everyone who was 
          introduced before you. Suppose the first 3 persons are Char, Ben, and Melanie. Char starts by saying: 
          <q>I'm Char. I like shopping in Chicago.</q> Ben says, <q>I'm Ben. I like baseball. This is Char; she likes shopping 
          in Chicago.</q> Melanie might say, <q>I'm Melanie, I like making meals. This is Ben; he likes baseball. This is Char; 
          she likes shopping in Chicago.</q> Introductions continue around the room with successive students introducing 
          everyone who came before them. If there are 30 students or more in class, the first half of the students introduce 
          themselves using this scheme, then the second half does the same starting over with the first person of the second 
          group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once introductions have been made, complete the following:
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Create a table to show the number of introductions made by each of the first 5 people and also the total number 
              of introductions made so far. 
            </p>
          </statement>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Look for and share any patterns you see in the table. 
            </p>
          </statement>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Determine the total number of introductions that have been made after 10 people, 15 people, and 20 people.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </task>
        <task>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Is there a way to find the number of introductions made by the whole class? How? What is the number? 
              How do you know?
            </p>
          </statement>
