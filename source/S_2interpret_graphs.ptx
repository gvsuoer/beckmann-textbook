    <title>Can You Walk These Graphs?</title>
    
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Use a Calculator-Based Ranger (<init>CBR</init>) connected to a graphing calculator to walk the graphs shown on the student page. For each graph, decide how you will move before you walk. If the graph created by the <init>CBR</init> does not match the graph on the student page, think more carefully about what movement the graph represents. Revise your walk to recreate the graph. What does the <m>x</m>-axis represent in terms of your movement? What does the <m>y</m>-axis represent in terms of your movement? How do you know?
      </p>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        <pubtitle>The Hare and the Tortoise</pubtitle> extends the work you began in <xref text="title" ref="act-walk-graphs"/> Now consider a race between two unlikely contestants. You will draw a graph to represent each contestant's movement and explain how you know each graph is correct. You will also analyze and interpret additional graphs of the Hare's performance in subsequent races. Finally, you will create your own graph and story to accompany it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taken together, these activities, <xref text="title" ref="act-walk-graphs"/> and <xref text="title" ref="act-hare-tort"/>, help you bring your extensive familiarity with traveling from one place to another to bear on your learning first about graphs and then about linear functions.
        <blockquote>
          
          <p>
            A hare one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the tortoise. The latter, laughing, said, <q>Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you in a race.</q> The hare, deeming her assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the fox should choose the course, and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race they started together. The tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The hare, trusting to his native swiftness, cared little about the race, and lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the tortoise had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue. <fn>(<url href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0275.html#townsend" visual="pitt.edu/~dash/type0275.html#townsend">Source</url>.
